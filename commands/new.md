# new
> The power of imagination makes us infinite - John Muir

The new command is one of the most insanely powerful things about Blix.  

It can create 100+ different projects and it's growing everyday.

To use run ```blix new``` and you'll be prompted for to provide a name for your new project.

Or you can pass in a name with ```blix new someName``` to skip the name prompt.

## Notes

If you're creating a new project that uses a Postgres db we recommend having your server running before you create the project.
It will execute the cli command to create a new Postgres db with your project name.
