# scripts
> Live in the future, then build what's missing. - Paul Graham

Scripts are one of the pillars of Blix. With the ```blix scripts``` command you can add a one of our scripts to an existing project or create a new custom script with an optional template. 

For learning more about how scripts work check out our [guide](/guide/basics/scripts.html)

## Future Changes
Expect how Blix scripts work to undergo heavy changes in the future. We may decide to remove the script from the project and keep optional templates, or switch to a yaml file, we're also considering a ML solution. Stay tuned.
