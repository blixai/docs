# Installation

## Try it out
If you wish to try Blix out without installing we recommend [using npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b). Run our help command to see a list of commands you can play with.

```shell
npx blix help  
```


## Global Installation

Blix is a cli tool and needs to be installed globally using your package manager of choice.

```shell
npm install -g blix
# OR
yarn add blix global
```

## Coming Soon: blix@next

Currently we're testing the heck out of Blix to make sure it works like a charm when it gets to you. Due to this there are currently slick features unavailable unless you clone the repo. We are working towards a solution where we have a weekly build that we push to a @next package version. In the meantime we're sorry for the inconvience!
