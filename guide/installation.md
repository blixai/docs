## Try it out
If you wish to try Blix out without installing we recommend [using npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b). Run our help command to see a list of commands you can play with.

npx blix@next help

## Global Installation

Blix is a cli tool and needs to be installed globally using your package manager of choice. 

```bash
npm install -g blix
# OR
yarn add blix global
```

## Use the latest features with blix@next
We can't guarantee stability but our testing process helps us catch errors before they make it to here.
```bash
npm install -g blix@next
# OR
yarn add blix@next global
```
