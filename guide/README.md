Blix is a **command line tool** and **scripting library** for Javascript applications. It can be used to create projects from scratch or integrate new features and tools into existing applications. Blix works to provide a pleasant, rapid development experience by leveraging **convention + configuration**. 

## CLI Commands: 
```bash
  blix new
  blix add
  blix scripts
  blix generate | g
  blix --help
  blix #list all options and commands
```  

## Quick Start: Build a new project from scratch:

To run Blix without installing it you can use [npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) to try it out!

```
npx blix@next new
```

You will then be prompted on what you need for your new project.
