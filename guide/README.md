# What is Blix?

Blix is a **command line tool** for Javascript applications. It can be used to create projects from scratch or integrate new features and tools into existing applications. Blix works to provide a pleasant, rapid development experience by leveraging **convention + configuration**. 

## Blix commands: 
```
  blix new <projectName>
  blix add
  blix scripts
  blix generate | g
  blix help
  blix version | -v
```  

## Quick Start: Build a new project from scratch:

To run Blix without installing it you can use [npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) to try it out!

```
npx blix new my-project 
```

You will then be prompted on what you need for your new project.
