> I want to build a car thatâ€™s faster than all of them - Enzo Ferrari

Blix was born out of a frustration over the lack of conventions in Javascript projects and hence lack of automation compared to those seen in frameworks like Ruby on Rails.
However, while moving to automate and speed up the development process Blix never forget's one thing: **hackability**. 
Rather than obscuring the scripts and configurations of projects Blix puts you in complete control. 
Blix **assumes the developer knows bes**t and tries to make everything as pleasant and amazing as possible while getting out of the way.

What initially began as a way to automate creating Redux projects is quickly becoming a way to build all things Javascript. I sincerely hope you enjoy using it as much as I do, if you have any questions please reach out to devjbull@gmail.com and I'll do my best to help!
